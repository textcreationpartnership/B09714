            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AFter the very copious Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of Education, the<hi> Gentleman's Calling, </hi>and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Excellent Advices of<hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Civil prudence </hi>and<hi> Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, </hi>it looks ſomewhat Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to invade any the leaſt part of that<hi> Subject.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I am ſo far from preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to<hi> vye </hi>Art and Contrivance, that the main Deſign of that Part of this Tract which interferes is
<pb facs="tcp:184688:3"/>to<hi> exemplifie </hi>and illuſtrate the Practicableneſs of thoſe General Rules and Inſtructions which the fore-mentioned Authours have deduced from Nature and Reaſon.

            <p>And truly to be juſt to them who have written before, the whole ſerviceableneſs of this ſmall thing doth depend upon and abſolutely require a previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous frequent Reſort to thoſe Books, which ought never to be out of the Studies of any<hi> School-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, Parent </hi>or<hi> Tutour </hi>in the Kingdom.</p>

            </p>
            <p>I have had Experience how far the Honour and Intereſt of<hi> Great Families </hi>is concerned in the Vertuous Accompliſhment of the Eldeſt Sons and Heirs: And if the Obſervations which mine own Experience hath<hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced </hi>me to make, are any thing worth, they are but a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Acknowledgement of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects which I have received from the Gentry, both<hi> Fathers </hi>and<hi> Sons.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object. II.</hi> The <hi>Romantick</hi> manner of Writing.</p>
            <p>Truly, when I was of the Age of thoſe perſons in kindneſs to whom I write, I then thought that Fiction and Intercourſe was ſomewhat more diverting than uniform <hi>Narrations</hi> or dogmatical <hi>Propoſitions.</hi> And I was about to ſay, that they better underſtand <hi>Hobbs</hi> his Senſe and Principles by <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:184688:5"/>and <hi>Philautus,</hi> than from the Grand Author himſelf: For there they ſee Conſequences diſplayed, and the <hi>Slye Connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> between Dangerous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions and Plauſible Premiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes expoſed, which was palliated before under Good Style and Language, and the <hi>Magiſterial</hi> Authority of the Proponent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object. III.</hi> The Style ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times will ſeem <hi>eager.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Verily this I my ſelf am af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of, for fear of <hi>Indecency, (no</hi> man being a competent Judge of his own Indecencies.)</p>
            <p>But two things I have to offer for my ſelf, if the good natur'd Reader will accept of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That I do aſſure him (who
<pb facs="tcp:184688:5"/>am beſt able) That no <hi>ſingle Perſon</hi> alive is aimed at or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be deſcribed and pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured in the angry Characters of a Fond Father, a Womaniſh Mother, Debauched Son, Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Daughter, Ill Schoolmaſter, Careleſs Tutor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that would be Rude and Barbarous.</p>
            <p>I ſet up one of <hi>Plato's Ideas</hi>'s, and ſometimes ſhoot Bitter Words, but this hurts none; there is no Bloud drawn from Univerſals.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whoever thinks the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage Angry; ſurely, if he would conſider well, Sharpneſs of Style would not be looked upon as more unneceſſary for <hi>Inſtruction,</hi> than pickled Sauces
<pb facs="tcp:184688:6"/>are for <hi>inſipid Meat:</hi> 'Tis true, they grate the Palate, but they make the Meat go down, and help <hi>Digeſtion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object. IV.</hi> Expreſſions ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>mean,</hi> and Similes too <hi>vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar:</hi> This I confeſs my ſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of, and is one Reaſon why I do not put my Name: but really, I knew not how to avoid it; I knew not how to expoſe and leſſen culpable things, but by <hi>culpable</hi> Language.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object. V.</hi> —Wandring and hunting out to fetch in <hi>hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous</hi> Matter.</p>
            <p>You may remember, that I told you before, how <hi>impatient</hi> Youth is wont to be, and how to <hi>chain it</hi> I know not, but by
<pb facs="tcp:184688:6"/>various and unpected Subjects: and there is not any Digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but ſome Perſon or other will be concern'd to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Deſign. And whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall be ſo kind as to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the <hi>Inſtructive</hi> part to his own Uſe, He is the Man for whom I write, and He only comprehends my Intention.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object. VI.</hi> Why doth it come out at ſuch a time as this?</p>
            <p>And why not? No dangerous Deſign, that I know, is in it, but this, that Gentlemens Sons may hereafter be bred up better than ſome of their <hi>Fathers</hi> have been.</p>
            <p>I have oftentimes griev'd, when I have conſidered the
<pb facs="tcp:184688:7"/>
               <hi>Gallant Youth</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentry, who have as good Parts, and are as well natur'd as any Men in <hi>Europe:</hi> and yet as to Learning and Politicks, I am ſorry to ſee ſome of them turn to ſo little Account in the Service of the King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
            <p>This was the occaſion of theſe Papers; and when they were firſt written, a Reverend Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine of good Eſtimation hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them read, was earneſt for their Publication: But the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Readings over, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Reflexionson them <hi>glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my Fancy,</hi> that then it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came too familiar, fulſome, and of no Taſte: And thence
<pb facs="tcp:184688:7"/>it lay buried in the Duſt for ſeveral years.</p>
            <p>A while ſince I faſtned upon it with <hi>a Freſh Stomach,</hi> and tho it did not taſte very ſalt, yet I thought it reliſhed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what better than it did before. And having added ſome few things, I communicated it to a Friend or two on whom I much depend; they were ſo complemental as to warrant the good Effect for which it was very ſincerely intended; <hi>Tutoring</hi> being now as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary (for ought I ſee) as ever. And thoſe young Gentlemen are able to read this, who want <hi>Age</hi> and <hi>Solidity</hi> to be affected with Learned Diſcourſes of
<pb facs="tcp:184688:8"/>Controverſies and Politicks.</p>
            <p>One thing I heartily beg of the Reader, if any <hi>Hint</hi> in theſe Papers, or any <hi>former Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe</hi> of this kind, ſuggeſt a Suſpicion of the Author, in the Name of <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> do not diſcover him: For at this time, when <hi>Writing,</hi> both as to Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Matter and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Language, is at high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, it is not fit to be ſubſcribed by a man, who hath thought away ſome Years.</p>

               <p>But another ſort of Writers there are with which <hi>this Age</hi> abounds, and which <hi>I</hi> mainly dwell upon: wherein with ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of ſtyle and ſeriouſneſs of thought. <hi>I</hi> find a <hi>ſincere</hi> ſtate of truth and juſt limits of duty, neither too looſe and large, left a man ſhould grow <hi>wanton,</hi> nor too ſtrict and ſcrupulous, leſt he ſhould <hi>diſpair.</hi> And all with a due <hi>movement</hi> of Paſſion; out of which I intend to ſhape a true <hi>Meaſure</hi> of my ſelf; learn the <hi>Contempt</hi> of what hitherto <hi>I</hi> haue admired; <hi>humble</hi> my Soul for my many failings, and <hi>warm</hi> my Devotions by the expectation of a wiſer and better ſtate.</p>

                     <hi>As for the next thing.</hi> The King's being under the neceſſity of a Parliament.</head>
                  <p>I know no neceſſity can be upon the King to call a Parliament but a Forein <hi>War</hi> and want of <hi>Money:</hi> As for a War, 'tis not likely (unleſs by the <hi>Moors</hi> upon <hi>Tangier</hi>) we have attempted to play the King at <hi>France,</hi> but they two will hardly meddle with one another; we have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to make <hi>Spain</hi> break with us, but they are <hi>poor,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> are <hi>cunning,</hi> ſo that his Majeſty is ſecure in that point, As for want of Money, it is ſaid and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that the King is now made a good Husband, and hath money in the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer: if ſo; it will bring down the price of Memberſhip: We had been better to have given him a million of money than to have ſuffer'd him ever to come to <hi>Think</hi> and grow cunning; for, if <hi>I</hi> ken him aright he hath Parts enough to govern a bigger Nation than this, if he can once endure the penance of <hi>Buſineſs</hi> and leave off to be afraid of meeting us at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> And it is probable he never will be ſo again, ſince the Succeſs of that Venture of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon us, in the amazing <hi>precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> diſſolution at <hi>Oxford;</hi> from which
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:184688:17"/>time <hi>I</hi> will be bold to date the ſinking of <hi>Parliamentary</hi> Grandieut.</p>
                  <p>I gueſs who it was within one man or two who for intereſt &amp; ſecurity thought it neceſſary that things ſhould be put to ſome <hi>iſſue</hi> at <hi>Oxford,</hi> the City being em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bittered by the removal of us, and things carried ſo high as to force the King ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſhew Fear and yield to <hi>terms;</hi> or Fury, and ſo act a ſevere part upon ſome Members, and by that give occaſion to a Tumult in the City, which then cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly was deſign'd.</p>
                  <p>Whereas you queſtion the King's <hi>Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in the Countery,</hi> let me tell you, <hi>I</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Countrey cools apace, and he who deals with the Vulgar muſt do his buſineſs quickly, for ſeven hours ſleep will make a Clown <hi>forget</hi> his deſign. It hath been no ſmall advantage to the King that his Adverſaries ſtill act with more <hi>noiſe</hi> and <hi>tumult</hi> than he: and though noiſe and tumult does wonders while it continues, yet when it once ſinks and grows calm, it is far more difficult to be uſefull again. I take the Vulgar to be like a <hi>Race horſe,</hi> when he is upon ſpeed it is a mighty pace, but if in the courſe he be checked and comes to <hi>trot,</hi> it is very hard to make him gallop again.</p>

                  <p>You will wonder how I ſhould come to be an Advocate for <hi>Oxford,</hi> who have railed at it for above forty years together, and perhaps upon better grounds than moſt men do.</p>
                  <p>I was entred there when the firſt great difficulties aroſe betwixt the old King and Parliament, and as much care was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as was uſual in the choice of a Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour: But as I came to underſtand there was a certain Maſter of Arts who was to be the next Tutour of courſe, and ſo the next Gentleman who entred was to be recommended to him in his turn, it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened <hi>I</hi> was the man, who came with to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Parts and Learning at the rate of a Gentleman; I had a great reverence for the Perſon that was to be my Guide, and a ſtrong opinion to be made very wiſe.</p>
                  <p>It happened that my Tutour was a great Philoſopher, which made me proud to hear of, expecting in ſome ſhort time to be ſo too: He began at firſt <hi>gloriouſly</hi> with me, to magnifie the advantages of a good Education: How the greateſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:184688:18"/>of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Truſt</hi> were ſupplied from the Univerſity: What a diſgrace it was to the Nation, and what an injury to Government of Church and State, that when other Gountries, <hi>France, Poland, Scotland,</hi> &amp;c. are ſtudious to diſcipline their Nobility and Gentry into <hi>good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Politicks</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> here eldeſt Sons are generally condemned to Hawks and Hounds, and Wiſdom left the Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>younger</hi> Brothers onely, and <hi>Poor</hi> mens Sons; That the mutual luſtre of a Diamond beſet with Gold was a mean <hi>Compariſon</hi> to Wiſedom in the breaſt of ſuch a man as I. This raviſhed my ruſtick modeſty, and made me proud with the thoughts of what <hi>I</hi> ſhould hereafter be. <hi>I</hi> out-waked the Bell, and ſcorned to be called to my Duty. <hi>I</hi> attended every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Eye for a Summons to Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, and thought every minute an hour till <hi>I</hi> was entred into that courſe of ſtudy, which was to make me and all my Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions happy. But alaſs! the ſame of his Parts and Learning had gained him Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance whoſe company was dearer than mine; ſo that a Lecture now and then was a great <hi>Condeſcention</hi> (and <hi>I</hi> moſt days in the week, when others were care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully looked after, left naked to infinite
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:184688:19"/>temptations of doing nothing, or worſe; but God's <hi>Grace,</hi> the good <hi>Example</hi> of my Parents and a <hi>natural</hi> Love of Vertue, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured me ſo far as to leave <hi>Oxford</hi> (the troubles coming on) though not much more learned, yet not much worſe than <hi>I</hi> came thither: I muſt in juſtice ſay in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Univerſity in general, that the growing <hi>diſturbances</hi> in Church and State, and ſome Diſputes in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, may well be ſuppoſed an unhappy occaſion of ſlackening the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> there at that time.</p>
                  <p>But this infinite Diſappointment did ſo afflict me, that when I came to have Children, I did almoſt ſwear them in their Childhood never to be friends with <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi> This peeviſhneſs of mine was much increaſed by a Chaplain of my Siſter's, who was made a Fellow of a College in the late times, and turned out upon the Reſtauration of the King. He ſought oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions continually to rail at the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity for Ignorance, Debauchery and Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, inſomuch that I ſent my eldeſt Son abroad, to try what improvement might be gained by travelling; at leaſt to divert. <hi>I</hi> would willingly have ſent him to the <hi>Inns of Court</hi> but that <hi>I</hi> had obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for theſe laſt twenty years how the

                  </p>
                  <p>Nothing but ſuch Reaſons as theſe can juſtifie my venturing my eldeſt Son ſo <hi>early</hi> into the wide world: And I muſt confeſs that when he returned from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Sea, <hi>I</hi> was pleaſed to ſee the ruff boyiſh humour <hi>filed</hi> a little, and ſhaped into much of a Man.

                  <p>But you muſt pardon two qualities he had contracted. 1. An humour of mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying things abroad in compariſon with his own Countrey. 2. A <hi>ſtatelineſs</hi> of behaviour, and contempt of mean Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance. The laſt of theſe <hi>I</hi> did not much diſcourage, finding him Juſt and Gharitable. For <hi>I</hi> have often ſeen young Gentlemen guarded from low and baſe Actions and Company by <hi>generoſity</hi> of Spirit. And how many men do you and I know, looſe enough (God help them) from the Bigotry of Conſcience, and yet upon the bare <hi>Religion</hi> of Honour, rather than diſgrace a worthy <hi>Family,</hi> misbecome a <hi>Character,</hi> or faile the <hi>opinion</hi> of the World, do as much ſcorn a baſe Action, will be as true to their Word, when they might gain by Lying; as far from chea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Widow, Miniſter, or Orphan, who cannot contend, or do any ungenteele thing, as that man who thinks the world to come worth twenty of theſe.</p>
                  <p>But (Nephew) you are <hi>Rich</hi> and <hi>Great,</hi> and therefore I muſt have a care you do not miſtake me, when I ſay I would have my eldeſt Son a little <hi>Stately:</hi> I do not mean any degree of that <hi>groſs</hi> imperious

                  <p>And not only the <hi>Vileneſs</hi> of the Sin makes the Proud Man as ſure to be hated in this World as he is to be Damn'd in the next; but the Proud Man is a greater <hi>Fool</hi> than I beleive he thinks <hi>himſelf:</hi> For he loſeth what he mainly aims at, inſtead of being Honour'd and Eſteem'd, he makes himſelf the moſt <hi>Contemptible</hi> thing alive. For he is diſcovered by all his Words, Actions and Deſigns, even when he <hi>counterſits</hi> Humility end Obligingneſs: oh how 'tis <hi>overdone,</hi> ſtrain'd and formal. It was always thought a great meaſure of Folly to be <hi>able</hi> to be Flattered, and of all men living if you meet with a Proud Man, you have him at your <hi>mercy;</hi> It is

                  <p>But to come to my <hi>Son</hi> again. It quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeared how <hi>ſad</hi> is the condition of a Gentleman without <hi>Learning.</hi> For wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſome ingenuous Diverſion to fill the <hi>deal</hi> of void time young Gentlemen have in the Countrey, and being aſhamed to be ſtill obliged to <hi>Silence</hi> in all diſcourſes of Learning and State, for want of more Knowledge; he fell into ſuch an <hi>immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> love of Sports that he was never well but when he was managing or talking of his Dogs: and in a little time became fit company for <hi>nothing</hi> elſe: Debauched, and wholly uſeleſs to King &amp; Country, and his Family, and if I had not been alive to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:184688:21"/>to ſecure the Eſtate, he prov'd as likely to have made a Gentleman of his Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard as any Man in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I know I am blam'd (but my Wife muſt bear her ſhare) for breeding him up at a <hi>mean School:</hi> For ſhe pretending the danger in <hi>great Schools</hi> of growing a Man too ſoon, and learning ill Tricks (but <hi>in Truth,</hi> becauſe this place was <hi>near,</hi> and ſhe could ſee him, and hear from him <hi>often</hi>) would hear of no other Maſter.</p>
                  <p>And really the Countrey Gentlemen are ſomewhat hardly dealt withal <hi>in this point:</hi> For ſometimes very mean Perſons are licenſed to ruine our Children, to the great Prejudice of Church and State; a School-maſter being the beſt or worſt Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in the Nation: not but that we have now as many worthy School-maſters as ever; but one Ignorant one doth miſchief enough.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament hath uſed all the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Caution imaginable, by referring that Affair to the Inſpection of the <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary:</hi> It cannot be objected, that we do not give <hi>encouragement</hi> enough to maintain fit Perſons; for I am bold to ſay, no Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman is ſo <hi>weak,</hi> as not <hi>Plentifully</hi> to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie that Perſon, who is to contribute to the Proſperity of a whole <hi>Family,</hi> by ſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

                  <p>But very Mean was that Perſon to whom I ſent my Son, upon my Wife's <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And perhaps, hereafter you may find it a very hard matter, not to be guided by a <hi>Wife</hi> in the <hi>breeding</hi> your Children. For that Fondneſs, which is a <hi>juſt debt</hi> from all to a Wife, and is in ſome by Nature ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive, if ſhe be cunning enough to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor it well with a few Tears or a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Fit, will melt your ſweet Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.

                  <p>I do not ſpeak this to <hi>diſcourage Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</hi> For I will ſincerely aver, that where the choice of <hi>Quality, Temper,</hi> and <hi>Fortune,</hi> is tolerably Prudent, there is a great deal more Happineſs than in a diſcontented, looſe, unſatisfied <hi>ſingle Life,</hi> unleſs to thoſe Perſons whoſe Callings oblige them to a continual <hi>Thoughtfulneſs</hi> and moderation of <hi>Diet.</hi>

                  <p>I cannot but ſpeak upon this Subject with a great <hi>Concern;</hi> For, I believe, if I had Married my Son immediately after his return from <hi>Travel,</hi> while he was a <hi>ſtranger</hi> to bad Company, and the Vices in <hi>faſhion,</hi> I might have prevented his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagances, and fixed the <hi>Mercury.</hi> But afterwards, too late, when I had provided an agreeable Match, his Comrades had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled into him ſuch an <hi>Averſion,</hi> and taught him to rail at Matrimony in the Language of the <hi>Stews,</hi> that the <hi>deſign</hi> of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to my Family, was utterly deſcated: And once, I remember, full of Grief, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Account, I was viſited by a Friend, who condoled the miſchief of ſuch <hi>Evil Principles,</hi> and the ſinful Conſequences of them. And, the better to relieve the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then I was oppreſſed with, and prate ſome of my <hi>Thoughtfulneſs</hi> away; I ask'd him, what he conceived were the Occaſions of the preſent great <hi>Contempt</hi> of <hi>Matrimony.</hi> He ſmiled, and told me, that he had no great skill in the buſineſs of <hi>Matrimony,</hi> but the Contempt of it, he thought, aroſe,</p>

                  <p>Being ſettled in his Dominion, leſt the forementioned humility and want of Learning (which Children are apt to ſmell out) ſhould end in Contempt. He puts on a great ſelf-conceit, ruffles amongſt the trembling Boys with a <hi>Fantaſtical Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> and procures the name of a ſtrict and careful Man by a partial Cruelty to poor Mens Children, for he knew Mothers had ſomewhat as ſoveraign as Crabs-Eyes to ſweeten the <hi>Choler,</hi> leſt the dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beloved Eldeſt Son ſhould come to a miſchance.</p>
                  <p>For a long time I ſtood by and look'd on, but my Wife did ſo <hi>hale</hi> and <hi>pu'l</hi> me to ſend my Child to ſo <hi>near</hi> a School, that I ſaw no hopes of Peace, till I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied; I had the Flattery of ſeveral Years, of the Dutifulneſs and Proficiency of my Son, which my Wife never doubted of; ſeeing her Son kept ſweet, neat in Cloaths, and Sheepiſh (which ſhe called <hi>Good-Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</hi>) This Sheepiſhneſs, or over Baſhful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his, I was troubled at, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to mend, becauſe of an Accident which I knew had befallen a young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman my Neighbour: He was a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel Youth, very fine in Parts and Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fition; his <hi>Mother</hi> was ſenſible of this, and fond enough; and ſo jealous of every
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:184688:25"/>Action, imperious and rigid to an hair's breadth of Duty, loud and noiſy at every ſmall miſcarriage, (and ſometimes at none.) This made the near Youth dread the place where-ever his Mother was: <hi>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morouſly</hi> perform every Duty for fear of being chidden, and at laſt ſo far diſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that when he grew up, and for Age and Knowledge was thought fit to be courted by the beſt ſort of Acquaintance, he was quite over-grown with that <hi>Curb</hi> of <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>publick</hi> Actions call'd <hi>Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas frontis;</hi> he would behave himſelf ſo diffidently, that ſenſe and words would fail him; and if his Mother came into the Room he was preſently ſtruck dumb.</p>
                  <p>Another Youth (exactly ſuch) I knew whoſe Schoolmaſter was rough and haſty, ſo that whenever he came into the School the gentle Boy trembled, his heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly aked for fear, and at laſt contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch an incurable Hectick as deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two Inſtances give me an una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable occaſion of recommending the Practice of the School-maſter I was bred up under: He was a plain man, skill'd in his Profeſſion, induſtrious and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s way was this; Firſt to ſift the Temper of every Youth; if he
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:184688:26"/>found a Boy <hi>ruggiſh and untractable,</hi> quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to eaſe himſelf of the uncomfortable duty of Severity: But if they were tract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and eaſie, what ever were their Parts or Learning, to make the beſt of both, encourage the Children with <hi>Civility</hi> and <hi>Kindneſs:</hi> He knew there was a <hi>Generoſity</hi> in Gentlemen, and that what Imperiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs could not do, Courteſie might, and out of <hi>Gratitude,</hi> and a ſenſe of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Care,</hi> he found better ſucceſs than if he had affrighted them into Duty.</p>
                  <p>Well, when my Boy grew toward a Man, I took him away, and upon Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, I found that he had ſent me home nothing but the very ſhell of a Gentleman, ſpruce indeed in Habit, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and well natur'd, but infinitely void of all Knowledge, either of Words or Things. It is true, I got him turn'd out; but in the mean time, my hopes were loſt, ſo that it became no ſmall Concern of mine to take better Care for the <hi>ſecond Son,</hi> who had ſmarted for a better ſhare of Learning ſomewhat than his Brother, at a <hi>greater School.</hi> Him therefore I was reſolved not to <hi>condemn</hi> (as Gentlemen phraſe it) but to prefer to a <hi>Profeſſion.</hi> But what Courſe to take, I was at a loſs. <hi>Cambridge</hi> was ſo far off, I could not

                  <p>There was in the Neighbour-hood an old grave Learned Divine (a rigid Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) and therefore thought me not Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous enough: but yet the great Integrity and Simplicity of this Life, and the Inof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſiveneſs of a free converſe in matters of Indifferency, was Reaſon enough to me of ſtanding by his <hi>Judgment</hi> in this great <hi>Confuſion</hi> of mine own Thoughts.</p>
                  <p>I deſired his advice in the choice of a Profeſſion, for I thought the Gentry and Nobility of this Nation, the moſt <hi>miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi> Men alive.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, for breeding the Elder and Young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Sons at one <hi>common</hi> Idle rate, as if both were to Inherit equally, ſo that afterwards when they grow Men, and a Diſtinction muſt of neceſſity be made, it always breeds ill Blood, and ſometimes proves dangerous.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, For thinking it ſomewhat <hi>beneath</hi> Perſons of Quality to gain a Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood by the induſtry of a Profeſſion, ſuch as a Child's inclination points to.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Phyſick</hi> we both did own to be in the ſpeculation very <hi>pleaſant,</hi> and in the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice <hi>gainful;</hi> but foraſmuch as Eminency in that Study requires a more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:184688:27"/>Knowledg in many ſorts of Learning, and is ſo full of Care and Hardſhip, we left that to ſuch who were furniſhed with more Learning, and invited by a ſtrong natural Propenſity thereunto.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Civil Law,</hi> was then propoſed as a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel ſort of Study, but when I conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into how few hands the Gains of that Profeſſion falls, and how few Offices of Preferment there are; I laid aſide all thoughts of that Learning, though moſt <hi>Honourable</hi> of any next to Divinity.</p>
                  <p>My Neighbour ſpake well and largely of Divinity; and ſuch was the <hi>honeſty</hi> and clearneſs of his Humour, that he franckly told me, that,<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> not favouring Epiſcopacy much, would hardly encourage a Son to be a Divine: I was not angry with his <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſigning</hi> plainneſs, but grievouſly afflicted not to be more truly known to him; and with ſome kind of trouble in Spirit, I made him my Confeſſor. I told him,</p>
                  <p>That it did pleaſe <hi>God,</hi> out of a Senſe of human Infirmity, I was naturally of a diſpoſition prone to great <hi>Pity</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion</hi> to ſuch as were Poor, moſt of all to ſuch as I ſaw Honeſt in their Morals, and, as I thought, ſincere in Religion. And that once (out of <hi>Curioſity</hi>) I went to a notorious Meeting, upon the fame of an
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:184688:27"/>extraordinary gifted Preacher. I would, I confeſs, willingly, being a Member of that Parliament (which made the Act of Uniformity) have <hi>contracted</hi> my ſelf, and not have been known to appear ſo much in oppoſition to it, but that could not be; and yet I was reſolved to ſee what matter of <hi>moment</hi> there was, to encourage my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring of Diſſenters, being Born of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, who paid dear for their Loyalty in the late times.</p>
                  <p>When the Meeters had given me the <hi>invidious</hi> unacceptable deference of Place, up ſprings a Man with a briskneſs of Look, fit to have domineer'd in the beſt Audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in <hi>England.</hi> He throws his gaping Eyes about upon the numerous throng.

                  <p>He began (I ſuppoſe upon a <hi>miſtake</hi> of his Auditory) with Addreſs, Language, Rhetorick, and thought as if he had been an Angel; and I never in all my Life time prepared my ſelf ſo much for attention; no not in the Houſe of Commons: But he <hi>Correcting</hi> himſelf, deſcended to ſuch a lamentable meanneſs of Looks, W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="4 letters">

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:184688:28"/>Shrugg and Whine, that I was altogether as much Aſhamed to be a Witneſs of what the Women ſigh'd at and admir'd: And coming home to my Lodging, ſent to ſpeak one Word with the Preacher, who enquiring what I was; and underſtanding me a <hi>Member</hi> of Parliament, ſhifted his Lodgings.</p>
                  <p>This afterwards, I complained of in the Houſe of Commons, freely confeſſing my Curioſity, and excuſing the ſame by the Deſign I had in it. But I perceived that ſome of the moſt clamorous Members, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Conventicles, laughed at the Story, and found out buſineſs of another kind to ſtop any reflection upon the Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces I related, from which time I began to be <hi>jealous</hi> of Conventicles, which before I <hi>pittied.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I went on, and told him farther, that I thought, if at the <hi>Reſtauration,</hi> ſome things had been left out of the Liturgy; and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers added, it might perhaps have bated many <hi>exoeptions</hi> which are now made, but never in my Life thought an Alteration of it <hi>afterwards</hi> ſafe for the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>That I go to Church with as much <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> as any Man breathing, admire the <hi>ſimple, full,</hi> and <hi>ſignificant</hi> ſtyle of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, and the diſtinction of ſhort Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects

                  </p>
                  <p>And as for change of the <hi>Monarchy</hi> into a Common-wealth, I ſcarce ever heard, I am ſure never endured, any Diſcourſe tending that way. Alas!

                  <p>Let the faults of Governours (ſaid I) and Government be what they will, it is much ſafer to bear theſe faults than to venture a <hi>Change:</hi> which I conſeſs many an innocent undeſigning man may contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to <hi>accidentally,</hi> but on purpoſe and ſtudiouſly, none but ſuch as either diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorged King and Church Lands at the Reſtauration, or ſuch as fail'd in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of great Places, or were diſpoſſeſſed

                  <p n="1">1. Whether my Son had <hi>Strength</hi> of Conſtitution, to undergo the Drudgery of ſix or ſeven Years cloſe Study.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whether living in an Univerſity as a <hi>Gentleman</hi> at large, without cloſe confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, would not habituate him to <hi>Lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> greater than that Study is conſiſtent with.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Great care muſt be taken, to give him ſound Notions of Juſtice and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Becauſe, though neither the Law nor any other Profeſſion brings any neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity on a Man, or irreſiſtible Temptations to be injurious, yet in all Profeſſions there are ſome, and in the Law, from the ſhew of Parts, being able to carry a doubtfull Cauſe: And I verily believe (ſaid he) that many a good Man at the hour of Death, doth repent of having ſerved the intereſt of an ill Suit, notwithſtanding
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:184688:31"/>the excuſe of being obliged by the <hi>Calling</hi> to ſpeak, having received his Fee. After all this, if I did ſtand it out in favour of the Law, then Logick, for a year or two in ſome Univerſity would be uſefull, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe frequent formal diſputation makes a Youth more <hi>attentive</hi> to a Diſcourſe, and more quickly apprehenſive of a falſe or weak Reaſoning.</p>
                  <p>And when I Objected my Prejudice againſt <hi>Oxford,</hi> from my own experience formerly, and from the Suggeſtions of my Siſter's Chaplain, juſt before and after the King came in: the firſt, he could not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for, the latter, he confeſſed in part was true, at the time it points out.</p>
                  <p>For of all places, the Univerſity being <hi>faſt</hi> to the Monarchy, ſuffering moſt, and being moſt weary of the Uſurpation, when <hi>Oliver</hi> was Dead, and <hi>Richard</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted, they ſaw through a maze of Changes, that in little time the Nation would be fond of that Government, which twenty years before they hated. The hopes of this made the Scholars talk aloud, drink Healths, and Curſe <hi>Meroz</hi> in the very Streets: Inſomuch that when the King came in, nay, when the King was but <hi>Voted</hi> in, they were not onely like them that Dream, but like them who
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:184688:31"/>are out of their Wits, Mad, ſtark ſtaring Mad; to Study was <hi>Fanaticiſm,</hi> to be Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate was down-right <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and thus it continued for a Twelve-Month, and thus it would have continued till this time, if it had not pleaſed God to raiſe up ſome Vice-Chancellors, who ſtemmed the Torrent which carried ſo much filth with it, and in defiance of the Loyal Zeal of the <hi>Learned,</hi> the Drunken Zeal of <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and the great Amazement of <hi>Young Gentlemen,</hi> who really knew not what they would have, but yet made the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt noiſe, reduced the Univerſity to that temperament, that a Man might Study and not be thought a <hi>Du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>And, if after all this, I thought well of an Univerſity, he adviſed me not to <hi>avoid</hi> this or that Houſe, becauſe a Vicious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd Perſon came thence, not to be <hi>fond</hi> of an Houſe becauſe I my ſelf was of it, or becauſe the Head thereof was a Fam'd Man: Theſe, ſaid he, many times prove very fallacious Meaſures: The on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſure Method to proceed by was the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:184688:32"/>known <hi>Integrity</hi> and <hi>Prudence</hi> of a <hi>Tutor,</hi> who would improve him if he were regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, if not, would certainly tell me it. Such an one he told me he knew, and would write unto.</p>
                  <p>Now, full of Inſtruction, I was not long in getting on Horſe-back, but an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy accident</hi> at <hi>Oxford</hi> had almoſt ſpoil'd all: For at ten of the Clock, in the Inn, there was ſuch a Roaring and Singing that my Hair ſtood an end, and my former Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices were ſo heightned, that I reſolved to loſe the Journey, and carry back my Son again, preſuming, that no noiſe in <hi>Oxford</hi> could be made but <hi>Scholars</hi> muſt do it: But the Proctour coming thither, and ſending two young pert Townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to the Priſon for the Riot, relieved my fears; and quickly came to my Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and perceiving my Boy deſigned for a Gown, told me that it was for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of ſuch <hi>fine Youths</hi> as he, that the Proctours made ſo bold with Gentlemens <hi>Lodgings.</hi> He was a Man of Preſence and ſuitable Addreſs, and upon my requeſt ſat down; I told him I was glad to ſee Authority <hi>diſcountenance</hi> the publick Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, becauſe it is an incredible <hi>ſcandal</hi> the Univerſity labours under, from the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that Countrey Gentlemen (who
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:184688:32"/>come and Lodge in <hi>Oxford</hi>) give of Rant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Inns and Taverns, as if there was no ſleeping in that Town for Scholars: He civily reply'd, that things might <hi>be better,</hi> but he thanked God they were <hi>no worſe;</hi> that Scholars did often bear the blame of <hi>Countrey Gentlemen</hi> and the <hi>Townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi> guilt, and that abſolutely to keep Young Men from publick Houſes was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, but by <hi>Parents</hi> injunction to their Children, by <hi>Tutors</hi> obſerving the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of their Pupils, and every Head of an Houſe commanding home in time all the <hi>Junior</hi> part at leaſt of their Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Prejudices</hi> we ſuffer under in the Country, he ſaid there were many reaſons of that: The conſtant <hi>Declamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> againſt us of thoſe intruding Members, who were turned out again in 60, the <hi>Hatred</hi> all Enemies of King and Church ſhew againſt us for being preſumed Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the <hi>Envy</hi> the Gentry bear us up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a falſe ſuppoſition of our <hi>Eaſe, Luxury,</hi> and <hi>Proſperity:</hi> To which, we our ſelves (ſaid he) do fooliſhly contribute by trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Friends in our Chambers, as ſplendid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as if we were worth <hi>thouſands,</hi> when perhaps half a Fellowſhip would not pay for two ſuch <hi>Dinners,</hi> as are made upon a
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:184688:33"/>ſlight occaſion. And of all Men Living, the <hi>Gentry</hi> ought not to be againſt us, or envy our <hi>moderate</hi> Fortunes, whoſe whole Employment is taking up in ſerving them, by <hi>Breeding</hi> their Sons here, and <hi>Serving</hi> their Cures hereafter. Perhaps it will be ſaid the Sons of ſome of them Miſcarry: It is great <hi>Pity</hi> any one ſhould, but I am ſure that Perſon ought to vindicate us, whoſe Son goes off <hi>Vertuouſly Bred:</hi> they do not know the <hi>Care</hi> is taken to ſecure their Children, and make them happy. I could willingly have heard him longer, but that he was to go his <hi>Rounds:</hi> It was pleaſant to ſee how my Son trembled, to ſee the Proctour come in, without knocking at his Father's Chamber-door.</p>
                  <p>The next Morning, I carried my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's Letter to the <hi>Tutor,</hi> who expreſs'd a juſt deference to the Hand, but did not ſeem <hi>fond</hi> of the Employment. I thought to have found him mightily <hi>Pleaſed</hi> with the Opinion we had of his Conduct, and the Credit of having a Gentleman's Son under his Charge, and the Father with his Cap in Hand: Inſtead of all this, he Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked at a rate, as if the Gentry were <hi>Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged</hi> to Tutours, more than Tutours to them. And when I asked him whether he thought me a Man who did not know
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:184688:33"/>how to be <hi>grateful?</hi> No, ſaid he, (with ſomewhat of ſharpneſs) I never met with a Gentleman backward in that in my life; and to tell you a great Truth, if I were of a <hi>craving Temper,</hi> I would not take half the care I do. For many Mothers (I would ſay Fathers too, were it not for ſhame) are ſo Wiſe as to think that Man much more accompliſhed for a Tutor, who can Cringe ſolemnly, Tattle in their way, lead them handſomely over a Gut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and kiſs their Hands with a good grace, than a Man of leſs <hi>Faſhion</hi> and <hi>Ceremony;</hi> who inſtead of flattering Parents, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouring the Son, ſets carefully to work, and lets the Youth know what he comes up for. Though, in the mean time, I do not think <hi>Clowniſhneſs</hi> a Vertue, but <hi>plain Dealing</hi> was always thought ſo: And ſome Parents have not Wit enough to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh theſe Two, eſpecially when they are a little Proudiſh: As for <hi>Ingratitude</hi> in Gentlemen, I never had any reaſon to complain; nay, I have often refuſed Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, when I thought my Pains over-valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though I believe <hi>(generally)</hi> an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Tutor ſells his Hours cheaper than the Fencer or Dancing-Maſter will. That which I value, is the great ſucceſs and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction I have had in the towardlineſs
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:184688:34"/>and proficiency of a great many Young Gentlemen, who, at this day, do the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity <hi>Credit,</hi> and the places where they live <hi>Good,</hi> by their excellent Example: But, to be in earneſt, the <hi>Care</hi> is Infinite, and the Fear they ſhould Miſcarry is very <hi>Afflicting:</hi> And yet, after all this, if the Divine you came from, told you, That he thought I would undertake your Son for his ſake, then I muſt do it; and your Son ſhall know, before your own Face, what he muſt <hi>truſt</hi> to. I do not ſee any lines of <hi>Diſobedience</hi> in his Countenance. But I muſt deſire you to lay your <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands</hi> upon him.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That he obſerve the Duties of the Houſe, for Prayers, Exerciſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as if he were the Son of a <hi>Beggar:</hi> for when a young Boy is plumed up with a <hi>new Suit,</hi> he is apt to fanſie himſelf a fine Thing: Becauſe he hath a penny Commors more than the reſt, therefore he ought to be abated a penny-worth of Duty, Learning, and Wiſdom. Whereas the Gentlemen in the Univerſity ought to do <hi>more Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ereiſe</hi> than others, for they ſtay but little Time there, and ought to be accompliſh'd in <hi>haſte,</hi> becauſe their Quality, and the National Concern make them Men <hi>apace.</hi> And truly, if Men may be heard in their
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:184688:34"/>own Cauſe, the Gentry are too ſevere in condemning the Univerſities for not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding home their Sons furniſh'd with <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thicks, Politicks, Rhetorick, Hiſtory,</hi> the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Learning of a Gentleman, <hi>Logick</hi> and <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> &amp;c. and other <hi>uſeful Parts;</hi> when they ſend up their Sons for Two, perhaps Three Years only, and ſuffer them to trifle away half that time too: It is an ungrateful task to the Tutor always to be <hi>Chiding,</hi> the Father muſt command <hi>greater Strictneſs;</hi> otherwiſe, when the Young Man, who hath been long in <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> and here finds his Shackles knocked off, and the Gate wide open, he will <hi>Ramble</hi> everlaſtingly, and make it work more than enough for us to keep him Sober: whereas, if they will take care that he be furniſh'd <hi>early</hi> at School with <hi>Latin,</hi> come up hither young and <hi>pliable,</hi> ſtay here and ſtudy hard for <hi>Five Years,</hi> then if he prove not able to do the King and his Country Service, I am content it ſhould be <hi>our Fault.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. That he writes no Letter to come home for the firſt <hi>whole Year.</hi> It is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and a very great inconvenience, that ſoon after a young Gentleman is ſettled, and but <hi>beginning to begin</hi> to Study; we have a tedious ill-ſpell'd Letter from a
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:184688:35"/>dear Siſter, who languiſhes and longs to ſee him as much, almoſt, as ſhe doth for a Husband: and this, together with riſing to Prayers at Six a Clock in the Morning, ſoftens the lazy Youth into a fond deſire of ſeeing them too: Then all on the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den up <hi>Poſts</hi> the Livery-Man, and the led Horſe, enquires for the Colledge where the young <hi>Squire</hi> lives, finds my young Maſter with his Boots and Spurs on <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand,</hi> quarrelling with the Man for not coming ſooner. The next news of him is at home, within a day or two he is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to a <hi>Hunting Match,</hi> and the Sickly Youth, who was ſcarce able to riſe to Prayers, can now riſe at Four of the Clock to a Fox-chaſe, then muſt he be treated at an Ale-Houſe, with a Rump of Beef, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Miles from home, hear an Uncle, Couſin, or Neighbour Rant and Swear; and after ſuch a ſort of <hi>Education</hi> for ſix or eight Weeks, full of Tears and Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, the ſad Soul returns to <hi>Oxford:</hi> his Brains have been ſo <hi>ſhogged,</hi> he cannot think in a Fortnight: And after all this, if the young man prove Debauch'd, the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſity muſt be blam'd. And, Sir, if you can bear a Truth, I hope you are not concerned in; the firſt Queſtion the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ſhould ask, is, in what kind of <hi>Family</hi>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:184688:35"/>and in <hi>what manner</hi> the Child hath been bred up before he comes to us. For, where Parents give good Examples them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and keep good Order in a Family, the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity Buſineſs</hi> is half done to our hands: But if he ſhall come out of a <hi>Sty</hi> or a <hi>Den,</hi> ſee his own Father carried up three times a Week to Bed; hear nothing but Oaths and ill Language from Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it muſt needs Vitiate the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Soul; he comes up Diſeaſed, and it will require very skilful Application to correct an Error in that firſt <hi>Concoction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. That he frequent not <hi>Publick Places,</hi> ſuch as are Bowling-Green, Racket-Court, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for, beſide the danger of firing his Blood by a <hi>Fever,</hi> heightning Paſſion into <hi>Curſing</hi> and <hi>Swearing,</hi> he muſt unavoidably grow acquainted with <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous</hi> Company, whether they are, or are not <hi>Vertuous.</hi> Nay, were his new Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance all very good, and of the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Houſe, the certainty of making him Idle, by receiving and paying <hi>Treats</hi> and <hi>Viſits</hi> is dangerous. I have ſeen two ſorts of Liquor, each of them cold when they were <hi>ſingly touched,</hi> but when they were put together, they flamed with ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Heat as melted the Glaſs they were in. Beſides this, all young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:184688:36"/>are not ſent to the Univerſity with the <hi>ſame deſign</hi> with your Son; I know a very Honeſt, Luſty Countrey Gentleman of four or five Thouſand a Year, who ſent his Heir to the Univerſity, meerly for <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit's</hi> ſake; and wiſely bid him ſpend what he would (which the Youth dutifully Obeyed), required no more of his <hi>Tutor</hi> than to keep him from knocking his Head againſt a Sign-poſt, and dirting his ſilken Stockings at Nine of the Clock: do you think ſuch a Man fit Company for your Son, whom you deſign to be Lord Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Be ſure that he diſcharge all Dues <hi>Quarterly,</hi> and not learn to run into Debt, this will make him gain Credit and Buy Cheaper. Whatever he ſaves of your Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, let it be his own gain, perhaps that may teach him <hi>Thrift,</hi> and if I were fit to be your Tutor, I would adviſe you to <hi>double</hi> it: for Prodigality is a little more catching than Niggardlineſs with <hi>Young Gentlemen.</hi> I know a Perſon in the World who lived with as much Credit in <hi>Oxford</hi> as any Man, always Genteel in Habit, and where Entertainments were, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing always Generous; and yet carried away with him a good Sum of Money, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of his Father's <hi>Allowance,</hi> and if
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:184688:36"/>he would give me leave, I would propoſe him as an <hi>Example</hi> to the Gentry of the Univerſity.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. What ever Letters of <hi>Complaints</hi> he writes home, I deſire you to ſend me a Copy: for ill-natur'd untoward Boys, when they find Diſcipline ſit hard upon them, they then will learn to Lye, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain and Rail againſt the Univerſity, the Colledge, and the Tutor, and with a <hi>whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> Letter, make the Mother, make the Father believe all that he can invent, when all this while his main deſign is to leave the Univerſity, and go home again to ſpanning Farthings.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. I underſtand, by one of your Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that you have brought him up a fine <hi>Padd</hi> to keep here for his Health's ſake, now I will tell you the uſe of an Horſe in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and then do as you think fit. The Horſe muſt be kept at an <hi>Ale-Houſe</hi> or an <hi>Inn,</hi> and he muſt have leave to go once <hi>every day</hi> to ſee him eat Oats, becauſe the Maſter's Eye makes him Fat: and it will not be <hi>Genteel</hi> to go often to an Houſe and ſpend nothing; and then there may be ſome danger of the Horſe grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>reſty,</hi> if he be not uſed often, ſo that you muſt give him leave to go to <hi>Abingdon</hi> once every Week to look out of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:184688:37"/>Window, and ſee the Maids ſell Turnips: and in one Month or two come home with a ſurfeit of Poyſoned Wine, and ſave any <hi>farther charges</hi> by dying: and then you will be troubled to ſend for your Horſe again: This was the unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a delicate Youth, whoſe great misfortune it was to be worth Two Thouſand a Year before he was <hi>One and Twenty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. That he go conſtantly to the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity Church</hi> on Sundays.</p>
                  <p>Before I came to be a Tutor, curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and a natural ſhare of Thoughtfulneſs made me obſerve the <hi>Tempers</hi> of the Youth of the Univerſity, ſuch as either <hi>Neceſſity</hi> or <hi>Accident</hi> had brought me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with: and I found one too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon an humour, which from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, I did Lament, foreſeeing, even then, a very unhappy conſequence of it. You ſhould ſee young Gentlemen mighty for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to haſten to St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s, and happy the Man who could get the foremoſt place in the <hi>Gallery:</hi> but if the Preacher, who came up, did not pleaſe, either with his <hi>Looks,</hi> his <hi>Voice,</hi> his <hi>Text,</hi> or any <hi>Whimſey</hi> elſe, immediately a great buſtling to get out; Neighbours of each ſide diſturbed to make the Gentleman room: (who ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:184688:37"/>drags half a ſcore along with him) eſpecially if he had a <hi>pointed Band,</hi> and a <hi>ſilk Suit,</hi> and kept a <hi>Brace of Geldings;</hi> Well, when they had <hi>Fought</hi> their way out into the Streets, they were for <hi>ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing</hi> their Fortunes at another Church; but there the Miniſter was <hi>practical, dull,</hi> and <hi>plain,</hi> and being uncertain what to doe, it being not yet <hi>Dinner</hi> time, they reſolved to ſtumble in at one holy Thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold more, and what with ſtaring about on the Auditors, talking aloud of, and cenſuring the Preacher, they made a hard ſhift to hold out till the little greezy Bells began to Ring to Veal and Mutton, and then by the <hi>modeſt admonition</hi> of going our, put the Miniſter in mind of being Civil to the reſt of the Hearers. Coming Home, they talk as big as Bull-Beef of each Man they Heard: Though if you ask the very Text, (Alas!) He Talked ſo low they could not remember that.</p>
                  <p>At laſt, I perceived that this <hi>Ambulatory Roving</hi> careleſsneſs of Humour, begat an indifferency of going to <hi>any Church</hi> at all: And ſo prepared the young Gentry, when they ſhould come to be let looſe into the wide World, to be no great oppoſers of <hi>Atheiſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:184688:38"/>
                  <p>This was unhappily contributed to, by the Diſputes concerning the <hi>Sabbath:</hi> Some contending for a very <hi>Jewiſh</hi> obſervation; Others, diſproving it's <hi>Morality,</hi> both brought contempt upon that Day, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally upon <hi>Religion</hi> it ſelf: As did alſo the Levelling Churches with Stables, and making the <hi>Inward Worſhip</hi> of God, oppoſe the <hi>Outward</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For whoſoever knows the great <hi>Lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>Supidity</hi> of the Vulgar, need not be told that Religion is kept up by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of the <hi>Lord's-day</hi> from other days; and if the <hi>Plough</hi> were ſtopp'd, a long <hi>Sermon</hi> Preach'd, and a <hi>Pſalm</hi> or two Sung, Religion, Name, and thing, would quickly be deſtroyed, and the Country Peoples <hi>Hair</hi> and <hi>Nails</hi> would grow as long as <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s in the fourth of <hi>Daniel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore, I pray Sir, command your Son to be true and juſt to the <hi>Out-ſide</hi> of Chriſtian Religion, and leave the reſt to God's <hi>Grace</hi> upon the uſe of means. Let him not harken to the Whiſpers of ſuch as would inſinuate diſtaſtful Notions of <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of Church-Government; for if he once grows <hi>diſſetled</hi> in his Mind from the Publick Worſhip, then he will pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keer out under every Hedge, for a <hi>new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> and finding himſelf diſappointed,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:184688:38"/>'tis odds but in a twelve Months time he may magnifie the <hi>Leviathan,</hi> and when he comes to that, if he doth not cut your Throat (provided he can doe it ſafely) for fear you diſinherit him, truly you are beholden to him.</p>

Oblige him to frequency of <hi>Writing Home:</hi> For coming to the Univerſity is not like going beyond Sea, where ſome Perſons learn to forget their <hi>Relations,</hi> and would abſolutely Slight them, were it not for a Bill now and then. Letters to and fro are ſome kind of <hi>Guard</hi> upon a Youth: And it will not onely be an <hi>honeſt</hi> means of filling up ſome Idle time, but will make him better able to Write an handſom Letter which is no diſparagment to a Gentleman, or to Write a good Hand, which few do. Beſide all this, he who begins to contemn his <hi>Relations,</hi> to whom he owes all, will quickly reckon <hi>Tutoring</hi> a Relation not ſo conſiderable and regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as at firſt he was told. And in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time <hi>Commands</hi> will look like Tyranny and Uſurpation; and then Tutour, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Vice-Chancellour, will never be able to balance the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. I would not have him grow in love with <hi>Cards</hi> and <hi>Dice.</hi> For though at firſt
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:184688:39"/>nothing may ſeem more harmleſs than to cheat a tedious hour or two with the loſs of a Trifle: Yet by degrees much Play will beget <hi>Skill,</hi> and Skill will beget <hi>Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> this will heighten Wagers: Frequent loſſes will encreaſe <hi>Paſſion:</hi> Frequent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts will make him think himſelf a greater <hi>Gameſter</hi> than really he is: And whenever he goes ſo far that Paſſion blinds what Skill he hath, or Opinion makes him bold of what Skill he hath not, then it will be time to ſend him up to <hi>London,</hi> to help maintain the Wits of the Town.</p>

               <head>General Directions for the better Education of a CHILD of Great Quality.</head>

CUre the <hi>Mother</hi> of the <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Fondneſs,</hi> if you can; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the <hi>Child</hi> will be bred ſo <hi>tenderly,</hi> as to be good for little. Every <hi>Door</hi> muſt be ſhut, and a <hi>Fire</hi> made in the midſt of <hi>July,</hi> while my young Maſter's a <hi>dreſſing;</hi> ſo that moſt times he doth not prove Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy enough to be Healthy or Wiſe. Take a curle headed <hi>Boy</hi> from the Side of a Beggar, (the Phlegmatick Off-ſpring of Butter-Milk, and ſowre Cheeſe) who runs Bare-headed all Day, and ſnoars all Night upon a Bagg of Straw: Take and ſpirit this Rational Clod into <hi>Turky;</hi> and after a Courſe of Hardſhip, in Thirty Years time, You may meet him at the Head of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand men, <hi>matching Politicks</hi> with all the witty and civiliz'd World. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <hi>Gentlemen</hi> are born with better <hi>Blood, Spirits,</hi> and <hi>Parts,</hi> than ſuch a <hi>Fellow;</hi> but you ſee what <hi>Diſcipline</hi> may do with One; while, through too much <hi>Warmth, Laxity,</hi> and <hi>Softneſs</hi> of <hi>Skin,</hi> the very <hi>Soul</hi> of the Other <hi>tranſpires</hi> and <hi>waſtes.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:184688:42"/>
               <p n="2">2. Though I would not have a <hi>Child</hi> dealt withal <hi>peeviſhly;</hi> yet it is of very ill Conſequence, always to <hi>gratifie</hi> him in the unſatiable Wantonneſs of his little Wiſhes. This naturally tends to the making him <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſome</hi> and <hi>ſelf-will'd,</hi> and all that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents get by that Quality, when he grows towards <hi>One and Twenty,</hi> they may put in their Eyes, and ſee never the worſe. Place a <hi>Child</hi> at the <hi>Table</hi> where there are <hi>Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Diſhes,</hi> He ſhall reach out his Finger, point and call for every one; and when he hath din'd, (too <hi>long</hi> by an Hour) ask him, If he will have this or that? he never fails to ſay, <hi>Yes:</hi> which is not worſe for his <hi>Health,</hi> than in other Inſtances for <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Good Care ought to be taken what <hi>Diet</hi> the <hi>Child</hi> eats: For, though I cannot mechanically ſhew, how heavy <hi>Pudding,</hi> and Salt, or (which is worſe) Freſh <hi>Beef,</hi> gets in, and mixeth with the Soul of a <hi>Child;</hi> yet I dare ſay, The Learn'd in <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick</hi> are able to prove, That the more of ſuch things you load a tender Stomach with, the longer you keep him from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Poet,</hi> or a <hi>Privy-Counceller.</hi> I ſhould go nigh to rail at <hi>Sweet-meats</hi> too; but that
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:184688:42"/>we have a ſcurvy Proverb of being ill-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd, if you love them not; whether <hi>Wine</hi> (which is now frequently given) be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for Children or no, you were beſt conſult the <hi>Doctor.</hi> Light Meats, Chick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, Mutton, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> once every Day, and Spoon-Meat are thought moſt agreeable.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>Exerciſe</hi> which a Child ſhould uſe, is to be conſidered: I would not have his Motions <hi>violent,</hi> but I would have him much <hi>ſtir,</hi> and often fan his Blood with dry and freſh <hi>Air:</hi> I have heard of a certain <hi>Great Lady,</hi> Mother of many Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which deſerved as much Fondneſs as any breathing; but inſtead of Riding in a Coach, and Glaſſes up, made them Walk out a Mile or two in a clear, ſharp, froſty Morning, put their Noſes and Lips into ſuch a <hi>Red</hi> and <hi>Blue</hi> that would have made half the Mothers in <hi>England</hi> think their Children <hi>Dying;</hi> but after this, I never heard any Man complain, that it ſpoil'd either their <hi>Health, Beauty,</hi> or their <hi>Wit.</hi> Of all Hardſhips, uſe the Child to <hi>Riſe</hi> early.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Care muſt be taken what Company the Child keeps.</p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:184688:43"/>
               <p>I am not yet come to the inconvenient mixture of Perſons of Quality in the <hi>ſame School</hi> with Tinkers and Coblers Children, which, perhaps, may teach them baſe, dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Qualities (they were never Born to) of Lying, Filching, Railing, Swearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> becauſe I have not yet reſolved my ſelf how it can be avoided: I am only now ſpeaking of a Child very young, and bred at Home.</p>
               <p>I have obſerved, that the Eldeſt Sons of Great Families, loſe Three Years at leaſt. For the common Cry is, that it is time enough to learn their Books when they come to be <hi>ſeven</hi> or <hi>eight</hi> years Old. This might in a degree be true enough, if in the mean time they did only converſe with Wiſe and Serious Companions.</p>
               <p>But when they are able to ſpeak and <hi>prate,</hi> they begin to be exceedingly <hi>accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> and the Dalliance of every Creature towards them is obliging; but all this while, this doth but invite the uſeleſs Tattle of a fooliſh <hi>Nurſe,</hi> a <hi>Foot-Boy,</hi> or a <hi>Kitchin-wench:</hi> and, if his Maſterſhip is to be pleaſed with ſeeing the Stable, and Sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on an <hi>Horſe,</hi> then he is farti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd with the ill-bred Language and Actions of the <hi>out-lying</hi> Servants alſo. This I mention, becauſe I know ſome
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:184688:43"/>Familes, in which Children ſometimes better Beloved then the reſt, or elſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there were no more, having had conſtant familiarity, and ſcarce any other converſe with their Parents, and <hi>Thoſe</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Experience and Thought. The Children have grown apace into <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Reflection,</hi> and made wiſer Perſons aſham'd of their own Age.</p>
               <p>But for a Child to be moſt in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Servants, and ſo many <hi>Livery-men</hi> always waiting and bare-headed, if it doth not make the <hi>Living-Creature</hi> Proud, Idle, and think himſelf fit to be a Lord, (before the King and Nation doth) truly he is leſs of kin to <hi>Adam</hi> than I am.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Since this Youth of Quality muſt be bred up at <hi>Home,</hi> my next Advice is, To get a grave, experienc'd, well-temper'd Perſon to manage him, by deſcending to all the little <hi>Obſervances</hi> his Age and your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation requires: But then I muſt have leave to tell you, that your <hi>Allowance</hi> muſt be very conſiderable, and his Eſtate will bear it: For no Wiſe Man will Play the Fool to <hi>no purpoſe:</hi> And if you or his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations ſhall fanſie that common Maxime, <hi>The cheaper the better,</hi> you will meet with Men, who will Serve and Pleaſe you, and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:184688:44"/>the Child at preſent; who perhaps hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, will reckon himſelf no great Gainer, when he finds the want of that Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment which his <hi>Quality</hi> and <hi>Parts</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and that his Brains were ſold for twenty Pounds a Year.</p>
               <p>It is not well enough conſidered, what it coſts to be Dearned and Wiſe, both pains and money: And where as Scholars are look'd on as <hi>Poor</hi> and <hi>Mean,</hi> born to ſerve them who have the luck to be Rich; yet I do not find truly that great Ones part eaſily with what they come hard by.</p>
               <p>I could tell you of a Perſon in the World, worth ſome Thouſands Yearly, a Man very conſiderable for Management, Temper, Juſtice, and all the Qualities of a Gentleman, if he had not placed too much Wiſedom in thrift. He had an Eldeſt Son incomparable for Parts and Good-Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and more willing to be made a Wife Man than Boys generally are. But the good Father, to ſave the charges of a great School, and Boarding abroad any where, was reſolv'd to diet him in Wiſedom at his own <hi>Table,</hi> with the cheap aſſiſtance of a poor Chaplain, who was to beſtow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him all the week as much Wiſeneſs as ten pounds a year, and a good ſtout Dinner is generally worth.</p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:184688:44"/>
               <p>When the young Heir came towards <hi>Age,</hi> I happened to be acquainted with him, and in ſome degrees of Familiarity; and finding very <hi>fine Parts</hi> in the Rubbiſh of a great deal of <hi>Clownery,</hi> I once dealt with him very <hi>Frowardly,</hi> and ask'd him plainly, How it came to paſs that he was not a <hi>Wifer</hi> Man? <hi>Ask my Father,</hi> ſaid he. And when I replied, That his Father was reputed a Diſcreet Man; <hi>Yes,</hi> ſaid the young Gentleman, and I thought him ſo, when I was a young <hi>Child:</hi> But now I am growu up, and the World expects ſome agreeable Converſation with my <hi>Age, Quality</hi> and <hi>Acquaintance,</hi> I appear ſo <hi>little</hi> in Company, and am ſenſible how little I appear, that I wiſh I had either only been Born with Wit enough not to be <hi>Begg'd,</hi> or that my Father had valued the Improvement of my Parts at a <hi>Thouſand</hi> a Year of my Eſtate.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Tutor, I propoſe, will do well by all the Artifice of Kindneſs, and eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to gain <hi>Affection</hi> from the Child. For otherwiſe by Force and bare Duty, he will Learn as little from that Tutor, as a <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> doth from the <hi>Miniſter,</hi> by the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon which is <hi>next</hi> Preach'd after he hath paid his <hi>Tithes.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:184688:45"/>
               <p n="8">8. Keep the Child, as much as poſſible, out of all Company, wherein there may be danger of ſeeing Actions of <hi>Rudeneſs, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decency, Debauchery, Infirmity,</hi> eſpecially if they are committed by near <hi>Relations,</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Mother, Brother, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Incredible is the <hi>obſervation</hi> of Children: And, I dare ſay, they think long before we perceive it; and the Reverence and Regard they have for Relations, recommends all Actions to their Imitation, with a ſtrong <hi>Prejudice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. By all Arts of Kindneſs, prevent <hi>Frowardneſs</hi> in him, which will turn to a very ill Quality, when he <hi>grows up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. When he is able to Speak plain, and capable to be Taught, let him learn <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Words</hi> together: I mean, Teach him ſuch Words as ſignifie ſome material Senſe, either of <hi>Breeding, Morality,</hi> or <hi>Religion;</hi> and not idle, uſeleſs Words, which ſignifie nothing but the Folly of ſuch as Teach them.</p>
               <p n="11">11. When you begin with him, do not <hi>clog</hi> him with too much, to make him <hi>loath</hi> or <hi>dread</hi> it; but let him come to the Book as to his <hi>Recreation,</hi> or to gain <hi>Credit.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:184688:45"/>
               <p n="12">12. Accuſtom him to kind and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly words even towards <hi>Servants</hi> and <hi>Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours.</hi> This will not only be obliging but will habituate the Child to Reſpect and Decency to men of <hi>higher Degree,</hi> to Parents and Tutor himſelf; and be ſure to inſtruct him of the <hi>regard</hi> to be had according to mens <hi>different</hi> Qualities.</p>
               <p n="13">13. The method how to teach him <hi>Latin</hi> with moſt advantage and expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I muſt wholly leave to the Tutor: For whether it be ſooner learn'd by the <hi>Rules</hi> of Grammar as is done in Schools, or barely by Conſtruing <hi>Authors</hi> and tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Latin with the Child always, by which ſometimes Gentlemen are taught, I am not able to anſwer mine own Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments for each: Uſe him much to Tranſlation, which I think much better than Compoſition.</p>
               <p n="14">14. Be ſure to keep him conſtant to <hi>Devotion,</hi> and let not his own private prayers be <hi>tedious</hi> and <hi>weariſome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. Make him able to reade <hi>Greek,</hi> and turn the <hi>Lexicon</hi> upon occaſion, as far as the Greek <hi>Teſtament.</hi>

               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:184688:46"/>
               <p n="16">16. A ſhort Series of the Hiſtory and Chronology of the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> by Queſtion and Anſwer, with a general Knowledge of the Globes, would be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and make him proud of Learning.</p>
               <p n="17">17. The excellent Qualities of <hi>Cyrus</hi> in <hi>Xenophon</hi> tranſlated &amp; commended would be an admirable Pattern for Emulation.</p>
               <p n="18">18. Of all the good Qualities, from the very beginning, accuſtome the Child to <hi>ſpeak the truth,</hi> and when he is faulty, do not affright him into lying, and ſilly excuſes (which Servants commonly teach them) but by mildneſs and <hi>ſecurity</hi> from childing, at the firſt beget in him the <hi>cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage</hi> of confeſſing his faults: Great Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Honour and Juſtice depend upon <hi>Veracity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="19">19. Whatever the Child doth well, either voluntary or out of obſervance of former Commands, be ſure let him have <hi>Commendation</hi> enough, this is a principal Reward and tickles the proud Fleſh.</p>
               <p n="20">20. Let no Perſon chide the Child who is in a great fit of Anger, leſt the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:184688:46"/>
                  <hi>violence</hi> of it make him moped, or the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decency</hi> of it make him grow careleſs.</p>
               <p n="21">21. I would not have Parents or Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour be <hi>always</hi> childing for little things: thoſe will better be mended by perſuaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and to chide for <hi>every</hi> fault alike, will in time make the Youth think great faults no worſe than little ones, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving a mere thing of courſe; 'tis the <hi>Common,</hi> but a very inartificial way.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Whenever you find the Child in an <hi>Extravagant</hi> fit of Froppiſhneſs and Anger (how little ſoever be the provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) do not expreſs anger to him at <hi>that time,</hi> but immediately ſweeten him, take his part, and get him out of the fitas ſoon as you can, leſt it grow <hi>violent</hi> and <hi>laſting,</hi> and at a cooler ſeaſon argue the <hi>indecorum</hi> with him, when <hi>Reaſon</hi> will come in to his aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p n="23">23. Never diſgrace the Child or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid him with his Follies before <hi>Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers:</hi> this may cut him too much, and never be forgotten; and it will be very obliging when he is afterwards made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand how kind you were in modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your reproofs for his <hi>Honours</hi> ſake.</p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:184688:47"/>
               <p n="24">24. Let not the Child be frighted with horrid ſtories of Bug-bears or idle tricks in the dark: the ill conſequences may be very-great.</p>
               <p n="25">25. Never let him be accuſtom'd to laugh at mens natural <hi>Infirmities,</hi> but give him occaſion from thence of thanking God who hath made the <hi>Difference.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="26">26. Magnifie and help him to admire the glorious parts of the Creation and variety therein: this will beget early No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Reverence and Honour for the <hi>Maker.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="27">27. Keep him from hearing any <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes</hi> diſputed in the place where he is, either of Religion, Morality, Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and when ever it happens, let him ſee his Parents and Tutor undertake always the <hi>better</hi> ſide.</p>
               <p n="28">28. A good ſhort Collection of <hi>Proverbs</hi> out of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and the Proverbs of each ſingle Nation (wherein their Wiſedom conſiſts) ſuch as reſpect <hi>God, Religion, good Manners, civil Breeding</hi> and <hi>Duty</hi> in all Relations, well digeſted into a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:184688:47"/>and under <hi>proper Heads,</hi> to be judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly explained to the Child at leiſure times, would be of incomparable uſe: Becauſe that ſhort grave, ſententious way of Inſtruction ſticks better in the <hi>Memory</hi> and helps his <hi>Thinking.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="29">29. Let him reade nothing by himſelf which is not very <hi>eaſie</hi> for him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, leſt it diſcourage his reading: and let all your Diſcourſes with him be very <hi>plain,</hi> and of ſuch things as he is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to be inſtructed in: this will help and <hi>draw out</hi> his Parts, whereas Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties will <hi>baulk</hi> and <hi>ſtifle</hi> them.</p>
               <p n="30">30. If you find him begin to grow <hi>pert</hi> and <hi>forward,</hi> never check him, but you muſt be ſure to <hi>modifie</hi> his Wit, you muſt ſet limits, and ſay hitherto and no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, bound it with Good-nature and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency: For there is one Quality mightily <hi>taking,</hi> and eſpecially if it diſcover it ſelf early in a Child, which is to <hi>Jeer</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect</hi> upon Men and their Actions: Beſide the Impudence, Ill-nature, and Abuſive Language which this is generally atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with (and ſo is the moſt unbeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Breeding for a <hi>Gentleman</hi>) it many times proves very dangerous in <hi>promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:184688:48"/>Company. It is not long ſince, for a Sentence no greater than the Wiſe mens of <hi>Greece</hi> (and not half ſo witty) a fine Gentleman had his Brains beaten out: <hi>Cicero</hi> was a great <hi>Jeſter,</hi> but the cry went on <hi>Antony</hi>'s ſide for Wit, when he had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten his Head off.</p>
               <p n="31">31. If you find him impetuouſly in <hi>love</hi> with any thing you do not like, you muſt not <hi>bluntly</hi> and <hi>ſuddenly</hi> check him, this may make him love it the more, and look on you as the <hi>Enemy</hi> of his Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but by degrees leſſen the <hi>value</hi> of the Object, perſuade him of its <hi>diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs,</hi> and divert him with ſomething more innocent, and of a differing nature,
<q>Alterius vires ſubtrahit alter amor.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="32">32. If you find him apt to take <hi>offence</hi> at any ſingle man's Perſon, diſguſt and hate him; by all means ſtrive to qualifie this, never reſt till you have made him a Friend, let him know the <hi>Duty</hi> and have the <hi>Honour</hi> of Forgiving. This may be of uſe if he live to be a <hi>great</hi> Man.</p>
               <p n="33">33. If you find him inclining to Thoughtfulneſs, Sadneſs and Sighing, correct it with all imaginable pains by
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:184688:48"/>pleaſant Converſe, light Diets, cheerfull Recreations, delightful Readings, leſt he get an Habit, and at laſt grow <hi>Melanchely,</hi> that is, uſeleſs and unſerviceable.</p>
               <p n="34">34. That all occaſions in <hi>his Company</hi> to magnifie <hi>Vertue</hi> and debaſe <hi>Vice:</hi> Furniſh him with Examples of both out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of God's Judgments and Deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: but till he is ripe enough to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, you may forbear letting him read thoſe Chapters wherein the <hi>failings</hi> of good Men are recorded. The Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Spirit of Devotion contained in the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> ſpeak them fitteſt to be read by a Child.</p>
               <p>Theſe (ſaid the Tutour to me) are the <hi>uppermoſt</hi> Rules that occur as <hi>abſolutely</hi> neceſſary to be obſerved in the firſt bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Perſon of Quality you talk of: Though, if your Dinner did not wait you, perhaps I might think of more, but firſt try theſe <hi>effectually,</hi> and conſult the Book of Education for other neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Inſtructions.</p>
               <p>I heartily thanked him, and finding it late, I invited him to Dinner with me at the <hi>Inn,</hi> but he refuſed, ſaying that ſuch Houſes were not built for <hi>Gown-men,</hi> and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:184688:49"/>made me leave my Son to dine with him, having (ſaid he) obſerved the great <hi>Improvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> of the Gentry who when they come to enter a Son, (which is commonly at the <hi>Act,</hi> that ſolemn ſeaſon of <hi>Luxury</hi>) bring <hi>Wife</hi> and <hi>Daughters</hi> to ſhew them the Univerſity; there's mighty Feaſting and drinking for a week, every Tavern examin'd, and all this with the company of a Child, forſooth, ſent up hither for <hi>Sobriety</hi> and <hi>Induſtry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this he invited us the next day to a Commons, and according to his <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour</hi> before, I expected to have been <hi>ſtarved</hi> in his Chamber, and the Girles drank Chocolette at no rate in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for fear of the <hi>worſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was very pleaſant to ſee, when we came, the <hi>conſtrain'd</hi> Artifice of an unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed Complement, Silver Tankards heaped one upon another, Napkins ſome twenty years younger than the reſt, Glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes fit for a <hi>Dutchman</hi> at an <hi>Eaſt-India Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And at laſt came an Entertainment big enough for ten <hi>Members</hi> of the Houſe: I was aſham'd, but would not diſoblige him, conſidering with my ſelf that I ſhould put this man to ſuch a charge of forty ſhillings at leaſt, to entertain me,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:184688:49"/>when for all his honeſt care and pains he is to have but forty or fifty ſhillings a Quarter, ſo that for one whole Quarter he muſt do the drudgery to my Son for nothing.</p>
               <p>After Dinner I went to the publick <hi>Bowling Green,</hi> it being the only Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I can affect. Coming in, I ſaw half a ſcore of the fineſt Youths, the Sun, I think, ever ſhined upon: they walked to and fro, with their hands in their Pockets, to ſee a match played by ſome Scholars and ſome Gentlemen fam'd for their skill. I gaped alſo and ſtared as a man in his way would do: But a Country ruff Gentleman, being like to <hi>loſe,</hi> did ſwear at ſuch a rate that my heart did grieve that thoſe fine young men ſhould <hi>hear</hi> it, and know there was ſuch a thing as <hi>ſwearing</hi> in the Kingdom. Coming to my Lodging, I charged my Son never to go to ſuch publick places unleſs he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to quarrel me.</p>
               <p>Having <hi>ſettled</hi> my Son and leſt my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands with him, we all made haſte home again, in earneſt much better ſatisfied with the <hi>Government</hi> of the Univerſity than I was before: for all this while I had as critically obſerved all miſcarriages as a <hi>prejudiced</hi> man may be imagined to do.</p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:184688:50"/>
               <p>And (to ſay more) when we were ſummon'd thither a while before to ſit in <hi>Parliament,</hi> I was reſolved narrowly to ſcan the carriage of the Univerſity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Members,</hi> to underſtand the temper and opinion, as far as the free converſe in <hi>Coffee Houſes</hi> (where every man's <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Politicks</hi> are quickly ſeen) could diſcover.</p>
               <p>The plainneſs and freedom <hi>young Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> us'd was odd at the firſt, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards very pleaſant, when it appeared to be a kind of <hi>Trade</hi> not Policy: For being uſed all the week long to diſpute Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes, the Diſputacity reached afterwards to matter of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>State.</hi> But in fine I perceived there was nothing of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign or malice in all this, but a <hi>road</hi> of Converſe, ariſing partly out of hatred to <hi>Fanaticks</hi> and want of <hi>experience</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in the world, which teaches men to be more cautious in promiſcuous diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>As for their <hi>Civility</hi> to the Members we muſt own it, we had their Lodgings (as good as they were) for nothing, with civility and reſpect whereever they met us <hi>agreeable:</hi> when at the ſame time the <hi>Townſmen</hi> put Dutch rates upon their Houſes, that under five or ſix pound a
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:184688:50"/>week a Whig could not have <hi>room enough</hi> to ſpeak Treaſon in. I could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive but they both talked and preached againſt Popery as much as any men, though in the buſineſs of Succeſſion they ſtill favoured the Duke. I walk'd the Streets as late as moſt people, and never in ten days time ever ſaw any Scholar rude or diſordered: ſo that as I grow old, and more engaged to ſpeak the <hi>truth,</hi> I do repent of the <hi>ill opinion</hi> I have had of that place, and hope to be farther obliged by a very good <hi>account</hi> of my Son.</p>
               <p>And upon the whole matter let me offer you one <hi>Caution,</hi> when you cry out <hi>Idle, Ignorant, Ill-bred, Dekauch'd, Popiſh</hi> Univerſity, I am ſure you ſpeak at a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and do but echo the <hi>ill-natured</hi> Fame of things: And ill Language doth not become the mouth of a <hi>Gentleman</hi> though the matter be true. But I am now convinced that we <hi>wrong</hi> them; As for their Idleneſs, the <hi>Graver</hi> ſort kept cloſe: 'tis true Curioſity brought out the <hi>young</hi> Gentlemen to ſee new Faces and ſhew their new Ribbons: for <hi>Ignorance</hi> we are not Judges, and the Nation generally frees them from that: for their <hi>Ill-bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi> Simplicity and Plainneſs is their
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:184688:51"/>Guiſe, and they look upon all things elſe as Art. <hi>Debauchery</hi> may happen among ſome of ſo many, but all my Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance abominate it as much as you and I do. And as for <hi>Popery,</hi> the moſt ſerious men I knew there ſtudy to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves able to reſiſt the <hi>Temptation:</hi> ſo that for us of the Gentry to rail at them for <hi>Popiſhly</hi> affected, and men forlorn as to Proteſtant Religion, is very <hi>Unjuſt</hi> and <hi>Uncharitable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the <hi>next place</hi> you beg my direction in the <hi>management of the Canvas:</hi> I confeſs I ſhall never be able to admire enough the moſt excellent Conſtitution of our Government by way of a Parliament, wherein the meaneſt Subject hath his juſt regard, and forty ſhillings a year makes a man wiſe enough to chuſe his <hi>Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive:</hi> nay now of late very <hi>Cottagers</hi> and <hi>Quakers</hi> come in for a ſhare in electing that Aſſembly, which for ought I know turns and winds the great Affairs of all <hi>Europe:</hi> Though I muſt confeſs I am ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that in <hi>Elections</hi> ſo little regard is had to the Wiſedom and Vertue of the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didate, and that ſo much uſe is made of the <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Vices</hi> of the people.</p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:184688:51"/>
               <p>It will not be ſafe to depend upon the vulgar of your own Party, becauſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them will appear to have no Votes either on Account of <hi>Swearing</hi> or <hi>Eſtates;</hi> and yet their Zeal for the Cauſe will hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them on to poll.</p>
               <p>If you manage your ſelf wiſely, I know no man can make a better <hi>Figure</hi> in the Field than you, and thus, preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of you in the <hi>Houſe,</hi> I will next give you my thoughts concerning your <hi>Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> there. For the leaſt misbehaviour at <hi>firſt coming</hi> is not eaſily forgotten in that Place.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I will recommend and furniſh you with Books and Copies which give an Account of the Original, Privileges and Proceedings in that Houſe, which will make you capable to act very ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, whether you prove a great Speaker or no.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It will be the beſt uſe you can make of the firſt three or four months (if you ſit ſo long) to be particularly acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Face, Parts and Deſigns of every Member, more particularly, I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe you,</p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:184688:52"/>
               <p n="1">1. Not to be a Speaker <hi>too ſoon,</hi> which is incident to Youth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whenever you ſpeak, your native <hi>Modeſty</hi> will be very becoming, and <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity</hi> withall; for we old Stagers did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways look on it as our Privilege to be <hi>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Meddle with no man's <hi>Perſon,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you do not know how many you diſoblige; do not begin early to reply to other mens Speeches, becauſe ſuch a man ought to be very conſidering and ready.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Never ſpeech it when you are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to be <hi>angry,</hi> becauſe it will be hard then to act with <hi>decency,</hi> required in ſo great a Meeting.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Study not to be much <hi>concern'd</hi> when you are replied upon with Sharpneſs or Jeer.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Beware of diſcovering any Affecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being <hi>Witty:</hi> for that ſhews you pleaſed with what you ſay, which is unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, and beneath the Opinion you
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:184688:52"/>ought to have of an Aſſembly ſo auguſt. Do not affect great Words, for a deſign to be thought Learned ſhews the <hi>want;</hi> and the more knowing any man is, the <hi>plainer</hi> he is able to expreſs his mind. But on the other ſide, you muſt not deſcend to low and mean expreſſions, that will ſavour of an <hi>ungenteel</hi> Breeding. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of all unuſual motions and geſtures of Head, Eyes, Hand, Body, or the like.</p>
               <p n="7">7. When any matter of great moment is debated, be not <hi>forward</hi> to ſpeak, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe at your Age it is impoſſible you ſhould comprehend the matter, deſign and managery of the Caſe. But be ſure at ſuch a time to <hi>frequent</hi> the Houſe, and be a diligent Auditour: for then you will hear the <hi>Reaſon, Law, Policy</hi> and <hi>Eloquence</hi> of our Engliſh Gentry: Maſculine Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence which flows upon all Occaſions, not conſtrain'd to the fulſome <hi>Anaphora's</hi> and <hi>Paranomaſia's</hi> of the modern Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, thoſe Whiſtles and Rattles of <hi>School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boys:</hi> Not but thoſe Figures when they were firſt, or now when they are wiſely uſed, are good Ornaments: But it is a vaſt miſtake to tranſplant thoſe Flowers out of the fertile ſoil of <hi>Cicero</hi> and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, and think they will thrive and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:184688:53"/>grow in every <hi>Clod-pate;</hi> to think that thoſe Schemes in a ſmall Epitome, robb'd of the Advantages to be underſtood, ſuch as are the <hi>Occaſion, Perſon, Time, Connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,</hi> &amp;c. ſhould by being barely learn'd by heart, make every Puny able to imitate the <hi>greateſt Maſter</hi> of Speech in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
               <p>When you come once to be taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of; then remember to fortifie your ſelf againſt ſolicitations to ſerve a <hi>Party,</hi> and that from men who will think they doe you <hi>Honour</hi> to vouchſafe you a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious <hi>Nod:</hi> the Inconveniences will be many.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Under <hi>Pretence</hi> of preparing Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs you muſt be a Slave to Clubbs of twelve, one, two, three of the Clock, whereby the Health will be impaired and ill Habits gotten.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You muſt then reſolve to <hi>captivate</hi> your Judgment to the Opinion of the Leading-men of your Party. And then your own Reaſon will be quite loſt, you will never attempt to examine the true merit of the Cauſe, and ſo many times be betray'd to the eager perſuit of what
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:184688:53"/>you would abhor did you well conſider what perhaps your mighty Leader purſues out of <hi>Paſſion, Intereſt</hi> or Human <hi>Inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,</hi> when all the while you think he doth act with due <hi>Deliberation; Integrity</hi> of <hi>Intention,</hi> and merely on <hi>Publick good:</hi> ſuch an Authoritative Leading-man is the Bane of any <hi>Society</hi> whatever.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You muſt expect to bear a ſhare in Anſwering for all the <hi>Imprudences</hi> of your Party. No number was ever ſo happily combined, but that ſome Perſons in it would be apt to act ſome <hi>extravagant</hi> Part, out of Zeal to ſerve a Cauſe, which will make a Thinking-man bluſh to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
               <p n="4">4. You certainly create Enemies to your ſelf, all of the <hi>oppoſite</hi> Perſuaſions, though you never had thoughts or deſign ſo to do. All Acts of unkindneſs recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or Acts of Revenge threatned, ſhall reſpect you as one of the Party, who are purely ſimple and paſſive, as much as if you had been the <hi>firſt</hi> Mover or Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner of the whole; this makes <hi>Neighbours, Friends, Kindred,</hi> at Daggers drawing when e'er they meet: Believe it, the neceſſary <hi>Mixture</hi> and Complication of your Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:184688:54"/>in the World, and the <hi>various Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> you muſt bear, will afford you Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſting more than enough. Create as few Troubles to your ſelf as you can.</p>
